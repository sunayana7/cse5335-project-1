1. Server side Framework: Node.js

•	For the above project, I have used Express.js which is a Node.js framework. Node is compatible with all the browsers. It provides 
Asynchronous APIs. It runs single threaded event based loop which is always ready to accept requests. I personally found Node to be easier to learn and adapt compared to other frameworks. The amount of material you get online to learn node helped a lot with this project. Node is also a widely used framework which makes learning it useful for future projects as well.


2. Client side Framework: JQuery

•	It is easy to integrate with any front end framework without any problem and has many built-in function which are ready-to-use. JQuery is efficient and secure and it has a large library compared to other Javascript libraries. JQuery and Ajax work well together and it requires less lines of code to achieve simple features. It is easy to play around with JSON and DOM in JQuery. It is a framework with is developing as days go by.
